You can take away our money, house, car, or even our clothes and we can survive. But if our health was taken away, we would surely die. That is why we always try to eat in a healthy way and exercise regularly.
In order to eat healthily, I usually avoid eating food high in fat, like French fries or cookies. I also eat little meat. I eat a lot of vegetables and fresh fruit which are full of vitamins.
Taking exercise every day helps us build a strong body. Regular exercise is an important part of keeping me healthy.
What's more, I think friends are an important part of one's health. Many studies show that people with a wide range of social contacts get sick less than those who don't.
I always feel better when I am with friends than when I am alone. When I am with my friends, I always laugh. Laughing is also an important part of health. I like to laugh with my friends.
By eating properly and exercising regularly, I can keep my body at a proper weight and keep healthy. By spending time with my friends, I can keep my mind as well as my body happy.
These things sound easy to do, but not many people can manage them. I think a strong will is necessary if we want to keep healthy.
